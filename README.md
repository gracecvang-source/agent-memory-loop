# Agent Memory Loop

This is a simple daily memory pipeline for stateful AI agents.

It converts activity into stable recall using a loop:

capture → organize → tag → journal

Goal:
Stop agents from drifting by turning logs into structured memory.

This project is designed to be readable first, automated second.

More documentation coming as the structure is cleaned for sharing.
